### Super Payroll

Super Payroll is a dapp built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows employers to create and manage payroll for their employees using the Superfluid protocol. The Superfluid protocol enables the creation of real-time, continuous payment streams that can be used for payroll, subscription payments, or any other use case where a steady, predictable flow of funds is required.

The Super Payroll dapp allows employers to add, delete, and update their employees, as well as create, update, and cancel payment streams for each employee. When an employer creates a payment stream for an employee, the Superfluid protocol creates a real-time, continuous payment stream between the employer and employee with the specified flow rate. The payment stream can be updated or cancelled at any time by the employer.

The Super Payroll dapp provides a transparent and efficient way for employers to manage payroll and for employees to receive their salaries in a timely and predictable manner. The use of the Superfluid protocol ensures that payment streams are fast, secure, and efficient, providing significant benefits over traditional payroll systems.
